You understand that we may cease support of old versions of the API.

1.4 Third Party Applications
“Third Party Applications” means computer software programs and other technology that are provided or made available to you or Authorized Users by third parties, including those with which the NewHomePage LLC Platform may interoperate, including, for example, your CRM software, marketing automation software, or sales enablement software, if any. NewHomePage LLC is not responsible for and does not endorse any Third Party Applications, services or websites linked to by the NewHomePage LLC Platform.

2. Fees & Taxes
2.1 Fees and Payment
You shall pay all fees stated in the Ordering Document (the “Subscription Fee”). All Subscription Fees are due upon execution of the Ordering Document and payable on the terms set forth therein.

By using the NewHomePage LLC Platform, you acknowledge that some of the individuals provided by NewHomePage LLC may have placed their telephone numbers on Telephone Number Suppression files.

5.4.1
Use of this service requires that you comply with all rules, regulations, and laws including the TCPA, TSR, national do-not-call registry . You must obtain opt-in permission from your contacts where required

5.4.2 Voicemail Delivery. Through your use of the Platform, we provide “straight to voicemail” messages, which are sometimes referred to as “ringless” voice messages. We make no representation or guarantee as to whether the target’s phone will ring, whether the target’s voicemail system will show a missed call notification, or whether the target’s voicemail system will actually deliver the message to the target. We have no control over whether telecommunications or voice mail providers filter or block your message or otherwise block ultimate delivery of your message or communication to the target contact. When you send messages through this service, we will designate individual messages as “sent” and will debit funds from your account if during transmission:(a)
We receive a "normal" SIP hangup cause from the phone subscriber;

As a result, you may be charged for messages that are not received by your target contact.


5.4.3
No Emergency Calling. If you purchase exclusive access to a telephone number from us you understand and agree that it is a voice-over-internet-protocol (VOIP) number, which does not offer traditional dial tone functionality. The Platform and services are not a replacement for traditional wireline services, nor are they a replacement for cellular services. YOU CANNOT MAKE EMERGENCY CALLS USING THE PLATFORM OR OUR SERVICES. IF YOU ATTEMPT TO MAKE A 911 CALL WHILE USING THE SERVICES FROM YOUR DESKTOP OR LAPTOP COMPUTER, YOU WILL RECEIVE AN ERROR MESSAGE STATING THAT THE CALL CANNOT BE COMPLETED. IF YOU ATTEMPT TO MAKE A 911 CALL USING THE OUR MOBILE APPLICATION ON YOUR MOBILE DEVICE, YOU WILL RECEIVE AN ERROR MESSAGE STATING THAT THE CALL CANNOT BE COMPLETED. Use of our services from a cellular phone does not interfere with your ability to place a 911 call from your mobile device as you would typically place such a call. It is only if you attempt to place an emergency call using the services through the actively running Platform that such a call will not complete. You agree to advise any users of the Platform that the Platform and its services do not provide emergency calling functionality. Accordingly, you must ensure that you and any other users of the Services have other communications services available to you or to them so that you and they are able to place emergency calls.

Pooled Numbers. The Platform has a pool of VOIP phone numbers that are shared between all customers when sending outgoing communications or other messages. We may modify, add or remove numbers from this pool in our discretion. If you elect to use one of the pooled numbers in using the Platform (as opposed to your own proprietary VOIP number), the Platform will attempt to select a number from the pool that is in close geographic proximity to the contact target. We cannot assure that there is or will be a number in the pool in the approximate geographic proximity of the contact target. In addition, we cannot assure that you that any number you have previously from the pool will remain available via the Platform for future use.

5.4.5

The Platform allows you access to an open API service for you or your developers to directly integrate the Platform into other third party software, services or applications of your choice.
