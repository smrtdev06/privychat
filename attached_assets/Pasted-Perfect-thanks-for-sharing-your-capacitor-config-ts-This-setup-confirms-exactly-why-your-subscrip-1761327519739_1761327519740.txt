Perfect — thanks for sharing your capacitor.config.ts.
This setup confirms exactly why your subscription plugin (In-App Purchases) isn’t working.

Let’s unpack what’s happening and how to fix it 👇

⚠️ The Core Issue

Your app is configured to load this remote URL at runtime:

server: {
  url: 'https://622e822f-d1a1-4fd9-828a-42c12b885a85-00-1hd0vg3rilq4.worf.replit.dev/'
}


That means your entire frontend is running from a remote website inside the WebView — not from your locally bundled assets (www folder).
When you do this, the Capacitor bridge is disabled for security reasons, so none of the native plugins (like InAppPurchases, PushNotifications, Filesystem, etc.) are injected into the JavaScript context of that site.

👉 Therefore, your call like:

InAppPurchase.getProducts(['your.product.id'])


fails silently — because the InAppPurchase object doesn’t exist in the remote context.

🧩 Why Capacitor Disables Plugins for Remote URLs

Capacitor exposes the native bridge only to trusted local origins (e.g. capacitor://localhost).
If it allowed any remote website to access native APIs, that would be a huge security risk — any injected script could read your app data, subscriptions, files, etc.

So in remote mode, your app acts like a regular in-app browser, not a full Capacitor app with plugin access.

✅ Solutions
Option 1 — Best practice: host your web app locally

This is what most production apps do.

Build your frontend (npm run build or equivalent).

Copy the build output into your Capacitor app’s www folder.

In capacitor.config.ts, remove the server.url and allowNavigation lines:

const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'com.newhomepage.privychat',
  appName: 'Calculator+',
  webDir: 'dist/public',
};


Run:

npx cap sync


Rebuild your app (npx cap open android or ios).

✅ Now your JS code runs inside the Capacitor context → the plugin bridge works → your subscription APIs return real products.

Option 2 — Keep remote site, but add a native bridge

If you must load a remote site (for example, to push instant updates via Replit), you can create a small communication bridge.

Here’s a minimal pattern:

🔹 Step 1. Inject a script into your WebView (native side)

In your Android MainActivity.java:

import android.webkit.WebView;
import com.getcapacitor.BridgeActivity;
import com.getcapacitor.PluginCall;
import org.json.JSONArray;

public class MainActivity extends BridgeActivity {
  @Override
  public void onStart() {
    super.onStart();

    WebView webView = getBridge().getWebView();
    webView.addJavascriptInterface(new Object() {
      @android.webkit.JavascriptInterface
      public void getProducts() {
        // Call your native plugin here, e.g. BillingClient
        // Then send result back via evaluateJavascript(...)
        String mockResult = "[{\"productId\":\"sub_premium\",\"price\":\"$9.99\"}]";
        webView.post(() ->
          webView.evaluateJavascript("window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('nativeProducts', { detail: " + mockResult + " }))", null)
        );
      }
    }, "NativeBridge");
  }
}

🔹 Step 2. From your remote website JS:
window.NativeBridge?.getProducts?.();

window.addEventListener('nativeProducts', (event) => {
  console.log('Products:', event.detail);
});


✅ This lets your remote site talk to the native layer securely through a whitelist.

⚠️ But it’s complex and must be audited for security — don’t use this approach for sensitive features unless you fully control the remote code.

Option 3 — Hybrid

You can:

Host your core app locally (so subscriptions work natively)

Load some dynamic sections (like user content or chat) remotely via <iframe> or API calls.

That way, you still get instant updates without losing plugin access.

🧠 TL;DR Summary
Mode	Capacitor Plugins Work?	Use Case
Local (bundled www)	✅ Yes	Best for production apps needing native features
Remote (server.url)	❌ No	Only for pure web apps without native plugins
Remote + Custom Bridge	⚙️ Partial	Advanced, not recommended unless you know what you’re doing

If you’d like, I can show you how to automatically switch between local and remote modes (e.g., remote for dev testing, local for app store builds).
Would you like me to show that setup?
