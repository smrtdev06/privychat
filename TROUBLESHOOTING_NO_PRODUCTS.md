## 🔍 Critical Question: Did You Upload Version 9.0?

**STOP - Check this first:**

On your phone, open the app:
1. Go to **Settings**
2. Scroll to bottom
3. Check the version number

### What does it say?

- **Version 8.0** → You're running the OLD version (product ID bug not fixed)
- **Version 9.0** → You have the NEW version (product ID is correct)

---

## 🚨 Most Common Causes

### 1. **Still Running Version 8** (Most Likely!)

If you see **Version 8.0** on your phone:

**Problem:** You downloaded the old APK from Internal Testing
**Solution:** Build and upload Version 9.0

```bash
# Build new version
npm run build
npx cap sync android
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Upload: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
# to Google Play Console → Internal Testing → Create new release
```

Then:
1. Wait 5-15 minutes for Google to process
2. **Uninstall** the old app from your phone
3. **Reinstall** from Play Store via Internal Testing link
4. Verify it shows **Version 9.0**

---

### 2. **Google Play Services Cache**

Even with correct version, cache can block products:

**Clear cache on your phone:**
1. Go to **Settings → Apps**
2. Find **Google Play Store** → Storage → **Clear Cache** (not data!)
3. Find **Google Play services** → Storage → **Clear Cache** (not data!)
4. **Reboot your phone**
5. Open the app again

---

### 3. **Wrong Gmail Account**

**Verify on your phone:**
1. Open **Play Store app**
2. Tap your profile icon (top right)
3. Check email shown

**Must be:** `smrtdev06@gmail.com` (your license tester account)

If different:
1. Settings → Accounts → Add account
2. Sign in with `smrtdev06@gmail.com`
3. Switch to that account in Play Store

---

### 4. **Internal Testing Not Fully Activated**

According to Google documentation (2024):

> **Internal Testing can take 5-7 days to fully activate after first upload**

**How long ago did you:**
- Create the subscription product?
- Upload to Internal Testing track?
- Activate the base plan?

If **less than 24 hours**, wait and try again tomorrow.

---

### 5. **Product Still Propagating**

When you first create a subscription in Google Play Console:

> **Products take 15 minutes to 2 hours to propagate to Google's servers**

**Try this:**
1. Go to Play Console → **Monetize → Subscriptions**
2. Check "Last updated" date on your base plan
3. If it's **today**, wait 1-2 hours

## 📱 Ultimate Test: Use Play Billing Lab

If nothing works, Google has a test tool:

1. Download **"Play Billing Lab"** from Play Store
2. Open it → Configuration
3. Enable **"Test subscriptions"**
4. Set your region/country
5. Tap **Activate**
6. Now test your app

This forces Google Play to return test data.
