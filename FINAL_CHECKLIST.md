## üîç Critical Checks (Do These in Order)

### ‚úÖ Check 1: Is the Base Plan ACTIVE?

**Go to Google Play Console:**
1. Navigate to: **Monetize ‚Üí Subscriptions ‚Üí Premium Yearly**
2. Click on base plan: **premium-yearly**

**If it says "Draft" or anything else:**

- Products take time to propagate after activation

---

### ‚úÖ Check 2: How Long Ago Was It Activated?

**When did you:**
- Create the subscription product?
- Activate the base plan?
- Upload to Internal Testing?

**If less than 2 hours ago:**
> ‚è±Ô∏è **Google Play products take 1-2 hours to propagate after first activation**

**Solution:** Wait and try again in 1 hour

### ‚úÖ Check 3: Was App Installed from Play Store?

- ‚ùå **USB install (adb install)** ‚Üí Won't work

### ‚úÖ Check 6: Country/Region Match

**Products are region-specific:**

2. Your phone's country must be in that list

**Check phone country:**
- Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Languages & input ‚Üí Languages
- Settings ‚Üí Accounts ‚Üí Google ‚Üí Account preferences

**If using VPN:** Turn it off - VPNs can block billing

2. Search for **"Play Billing Lab"** (by Google)
3. Download and install
4. Open it ‚Üí tap **Configuration**
5. Enable **"Test subscriptions"**
