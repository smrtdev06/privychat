## üîß **Method 2: Build with Command Line**

### For Android App Bundle (AAB - Recommended):
```bash
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

**Output location:**
```
android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

### For APK:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

**Output location:**
```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

---

## üì§ **Upload to Google Play Console**

### First Time Upload:
1. Go to: [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. **Create new app** or select existing app
3. Navigate to: **Release ‚Üí Production ‚Üí Create new release**
4. Upload your `app-release.aab` file
5. **Enable Google Play App Signing** (highly recommended!)
   - Google will manage your production signing key
   - If you lose your upload key, Google can reset it

### Updating Existing App:
1. Increment version in `android/app/build.gradle`:
   ```gradle
   versionCode 2  // Increment this
   versionName "1.1"  // Update version name
   ```
2. Rebuild the AAB/APK
3. Upload to Play Console

## üîê **Google Play App Signing**

When you upload your first release, Google will ask you to enroll in **App Signing**.

### ‚úÖ Benefits:
- Google securely manages your app signing key
- You can reset your upload key if lost
- Enhanced security and key rotation
- Optimized APK delivery

### üìã How It Works:
1. **Upload Key** (your keystore) ‚Üí Used to upload to Play Console
2. **App Signing Key** (Google manages) ‚Üí Used for production releases

**Your keystore = Upload Key**  
**Google generates = App Signing Key**

---

## üîç **Verify Your Build**

Check the signing certificate:
```bash
cd android
keytool -printcert -jarfile app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

Or for APK:
```bash
keytool -printcert -jarfile app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

Should show:
```
Owner: CN=PrivyCalc, OU=Mobile Apps, O=PrivyCalc...
SHA256: 48:A8:B2:1B:4F:42:79:D6:57:10:9E:0A:4C:16:93:B7...
```
