## Debugging Tools

The `MobileSubscription` component has comprehensive debug logging:

```

üåâ Using remote bridge mode (iframe)
üöÄ Initializing store via bridge...
‚úÖ Products loaded successfully!

```

### Check Backend Logs
Monitor server logs for:

- Webhook events
- Database updates

### Check Database

```sql
-- Check user subscription status
SELECT id, username, subscription_type, subscription_expires_at 
FROM users WHERE username = 'testuser';

-- Check mobile subscriptions
SELECT * FROM mobile_subscriptions 
WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID_HERE' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check promo code redemptions
SELECT * FROM promo_code_redemptions 
WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID_HERE' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
